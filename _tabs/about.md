I have a broad range of interests in mathematics, physics, computer science, and the Earth sciences. Much of what I post will cover one of my hobbies, the evaluation of integrals and series, but more serious topics will usually fall into one of the following categories:

* Number theory:
    - I enjoy algebraic number theory, and the study of elliptic curves and modular forms.

* Physics:
    - My favorite topics here are quantum mechanics and general relativity, low temperature physics and black holes are fascinating to me.

* Computer science:
    - As a hobby, I like to design microprocessors and microcode computer systems.
    - On the more serious side, I like scientific computing and data science.


* Earth science:
    - Geology: I hunt for fossils and minerals, like to learn about the history of the land around us, and enjoy leanring the science of how it got that way.
    - Astronomy: Anything in astronomy and astrophysics is of interest to me.
