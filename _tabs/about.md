I have a broad range of interests in mathematics, physics, computer science, and the Earth sciences. Much of what I post will cover one of my hobbies, the evaluation of integrals and series, but more serious topics will usually fall into one of the following categories:

* Number theory:
    - Algebraic number theory
    - Elliptic curves and modular forms

* Physics:
    - General relativity and astrophysics
    - Quantum mechanics

* Computer science:
    - Microprocessors and microcode computer systems
    - Scientific computing and data science


* Earth science:
    - Geology


The image in the sidebar is an icosahedral tessellation of a sphere as shown in [Continued Fractions and Modular Functions](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~wdduke/preprints/bams4.pdf) by W. Duke. The symmetries of this tiling correspond to M&ouml;bius transformations that are intimately relate to the functional equations satisfied by Ramanujan's continued fraction.
