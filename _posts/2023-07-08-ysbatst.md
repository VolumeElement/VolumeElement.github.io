There are many variants of the "You should be able to solve this." meme, the most famous being the [Haruhi problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpermutation#Lower_bounds,_or_the_Haruhi_problem). Many have definite solutions but the problems are often complex or intractable, while some are purposefully ill-posed to act as traps. One of my favorites is the following,

which lies in a sweet-spot of interesting yet tractable problems, at least with respect to other similar images of this format that I have seen.

## Solution

Let $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_{\geq0}$ be the set of non-negative, real, algebraic numbers and define 

$$C_P=\bigcup_{\alpha\in\bar{\mathbb{Q}}_{\geq0}}\left\{X\in\mathbb{R}^2\,|\,d(X,\,P)=\alpha\right\},$$

these are the points the punch fails to eliminate when applied at $P$. Note that we are including the circle of radius $0$.

It easy is easy to see that punching out $0$ points or $1$ point is insufficient to knock out the whole plane. Punching out $2$ points $P\neq Q$ is also insufficient because $C_P\cap C_Q$ is non-empty, as it contains the intersections of circles in $C_P$ and $C_Q$.



So what about $3$ points? Consider punching out $(0,\,0)$ and $(1,\,0)$. Any point $(x_0,\,y_0)\in C_{(0,\,0)}\cap C_{(1,\,0)}$ must be the solution to

$$x_0^2+y_0^2=\alpha^2,$$

$$(x_0-1)^2+y_0^2=\beta^2$$

where $\alpha$ is the radius of a circle about $(0,\,0)$ in $C_{(0,\,0)}$ and $\beta$ is the radius of a circle about $(1,\,0)$ in $C_{(1,\,0)}$. One may rearrange the above equations to show $x_0$ is the solution to a polynomial equation with algebraic coefficients (hence so is $y_0$), and the algebraic numbers are algebraically closed so this implies that $x_0$ and $y_0$ are algebraic numbers.

Now consider applying the hole punch at $(\pi,\,0)$, if we have $(x_0,\,y_0)\in C_{(\pi,\,0)}$ then

$$(x_0-\pi)^2+y_0^2=\gamma^2$$

for some algebraic number $\gamma$. But this implies that $\pi$ is algebraic, a contradiction. Thus applying the punch to $C_{(0,\,0)}$, $C_{(1,\,0)}$, and $C_{(\pi,\,0)}$ is sufficient to clear the whole plane.
